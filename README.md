# JavaScript All-In-One for Dummies

I'm learning JavaScript, React, Vue, Svelte and Node from JavaScript All-In-One for Dummies by Chris Minnick.

## Usage

1. Include gamelet.js in an HTML document containing an element with an id of 'ball'.

```html
<div id="ball">@</div>
<script src="gamelet.js" />
```
